# Stripe Tool for Hive Framework

Production-ready Stripe payment processing and billing automation for Hive agents.

## Overview

The Stripe Tool provides comprehensive integration with the Stripe payment API, enabling automated billing operations, subscription management, payment processing, and customer relationship management through Hive agents.

## What It Does

This tool enables Hive agents to programmatically manage the complete billing lifecycle:

- **Customer Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete customer records. Search customers by email and manage contact information.
- **Subscription Lifecycle**: Handle subscription creation, updates, pauses, resumptions, and cancellations with support for trial periods.
- **Invoice Operations**: Generate, finalize, send, pay, and void invoices. Track invoice status and payment history.
- **Payment Processing**: Process one-time and recurring payments through payment intents, checkout sessions, and payment links.
- **Product Catalog**: Manage products and pricing models including one-time and recurring prices.
- **Refund Management**: Process full or partial refunds and track refund status.
- **Webhook Verification**: Securely verify and process Stripe webhook events.

## Use Cases

**Support Operations**: Automatically verify customer subscription status, process refund requests, and retrieve payment history.

**Sales Automation**: Generate instant payment links during conversations, create checkout sessions for prospects, and track conversions.

**Operations Management**: Send automated reminders for overdue invoices, manage failed payment retries, and handle subscription changes.

**Analytics & Reporting**: Calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), track churn rates, analyze payment trends, and generate revenue reports.
